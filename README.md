# AquaSafe: Business Analytics for Water Disparity and Product Deployment

AquaSafe is a data-informed project focused on addressing water scarcity in regions affected by displacement. Developed as part of a multidisciplinary capstone, the project supports the strategic planning of a hypothetical water filtration product for humanitarian use.

As the business analytics lead, I created demand forecasts and interactive dashboards using data from UNHCR and FAO AQUASTAT. The analysis identified high-priority deployment regions, such as Cambodia, and informed cross-functional decisions in marketing, finance, accounting, and international business.
