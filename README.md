# AquaSafe | Business Analytics for Humanitarian Product Deployment

**AquaSafe** is a data-driven initiative developed as part of a multidisciplinary university capstone project. The goal was to evaluate global water stress and displacement data to inform the deployment strategy of a hypothetical water filtration product designed for humanitarian use.

As the **Business Analytics Lead**, I was responsible for translating complex datasets into actionable insights that guided strategic decisions across finance, marketing, accounting, and international business functions.

## Project Objective

To identify high-need regions where water scarcity and population displacement intersect, and to recommend scalable, data-supported strategies for early product deployment and partnership development.

---

## My Contributions

- **Forecast Modeling**  
  Built displacement trend models (2025–2030) using Holt’s Linear Trend method in Excel under both baseline and high-impact scenarios.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Designed an interactive **Tableau dashboard** integrating FAO AQUASTAT and UNHCR data to identify regional hotspots for deployment.

- **Strategic Analysis**  
  Recommended Cambodia as a high-priority launch market based on quantitative analysis of water stress, rural infrastructure, and internal displacement trends.

- **Cross-Functional Communication**  
  Translated analytical findings into targeted insights for use by marketing (regional campaigns), finance (revenue projections), accounting (warehousing strategy), and international business (B2NGO partnerships).

## Tools & Technologies

- Excel (Holt’s Linear Trend Forecasting)
- Tableau (Geospatial Dashboards and Data Overlays)
- FAO AQUASTAT (Global Water Stress Data)
- UNHCR (Displacement Statistics)
- Qualitative stakeholder input for validation and scenario testing

---

## Key Insights

- Over 45 countries face high to extreme water stress, often overlapping with regions experiencing climate or conflict-driven displacement.
- Forecasts indicate up to 30 million potential users of water filtration technology by 2030.
- Localised strategies, such as targeting rural Cambodian provinces, increase both humanitarian impact and operational efficiency.

## About the Team

This project was completed as part of MQBS3010, a business capstone course at Macquarie University. The team included students from finance, marketing, accounting, and international business. Collaboration was structured to simulate a real-world product launch and expansion strategy for an early-stage startup with social impact goals.

This repository demonstrates how data analytics can support ethical, scalable, and context-aware decision making in humanitarian contexts.
